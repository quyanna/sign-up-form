# sign-up-form

A sign up form made with vanilla CSS and HTML. Fluid and responsive. NOT a phishing scheme. 

## Skills practiced

- Designing webpages from minimal design documents.
- Creating bespoke front-end UI elements without using frameworks or libraries.
- Increasing responsiveness and accessibility of webpages with:
  - Flexbox
  - Dynamic size values
  - Media queries
  - Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Cross-browser compatibility using CSS reset and normalize.
- Typography and font optimization.
- Semantic HTML.

## How to use

- Download the files and open index.html in your browser OR
- If hosted on GitHub Pages, you can also view it there.

#### Notes

Please disregard the poor/minimal form validation, as I did not use any JavaScript for this.
This form does not save any of your information, anything you submit is appended to the end of the url as a query string for your temporary viewing pleasure.
